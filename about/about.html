                    Curiosity may have killed the cat, but it certainly has not killed me. <mark>I am a Ghanaian-American entrepreneur and UX designer</mark>. 
                    I started my college career on a blurry path, sure of what I wanted to do but unsure how to accomplish it. For some time, I have been exploring the different majors offered at 
                    my school based on her diverse interests and skill sets. As a member of the Class of 2023, I have a <mark>B.S. in Integrated Design and Media</mark> at <mark>New York University 
                    (NYU), Tandon School of Engineering</mark>. I was a campus leader and active member of the NYU Tandon and Opportunity Programs (OP) community. I am an OP Scholar, and former Poly Project 
                    Ambassador, OP Student Coordinator, and a OP Summer Peer Leader. After graduating this May, I also hope to pursue my Master's in Integrated Marketing and 
                    Integrated Design and Media with the dream of developing and launching my business plans. Through imagination, my interests, and God's grace, I continue to lead myself onto 
                    new and brighter paths.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <mark>I love reflecting on, researching, and developing creative ways to solve issues</mark>. As a result, I have partaken in several personal projects. Some of my projects include an 
                    animation studio where I can visually express messages to my audience and a future app development, such as a new shuttle app for my alma mater, NYU. 
                    Currently, I have my own Etsy shop, BeyondBeautifulByAma, and I hope to expand and revamp my brand, eventually moving from the Etsy platform to stand 
                    independently. Across my future businesses, I aspire to embody a resilience, determination,love whenever consumers utilize my products or experience my 
                    services.
                </p>
                <p>  
                    Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy partaking in various <mark>multifaceted hobbies</mark>: painting and drawing, baking and cooking, fitness, watching anime, 
                    skateboarding, creating narratives, designing, photography, and stand-up comedy.
